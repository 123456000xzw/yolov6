# About the naming of YOLOv6

### WHY named YOLOv6 ?
1. We developd the algorithm dedicated to industrial applications, and made some improvements based on the work of the YOLO series. Therefore, we named the project YOLOv6 to pay tribute to the work of YOLO series.
2. Actually, the full name of the project is MT-YOLOv6, and we call it YOLOv6 for brevity.
3. As for the project, we'll continue to improve and maintain it, contributing more values for industrial applications.

P.S. We are contacting the authors of YOLO series about the naming of YOLOv6.

Thanks for your attentionÔºÅ
