# About the naming of YOLOv6

### WHY named YOLOv6 ?
We developd the algorithm dedicated to industrial applications, and made some improvements based on the work of the YOLO series. In the future, we'll continue to improve and maintain this project, keeping the work of YOLO series alive, and contributing more values for industrial applications.

P.S. We are contacting the authors of YOLO series about the naming of YOLOv6, and maybe rename the project MT-YOLO.

Thanks for your attention!
